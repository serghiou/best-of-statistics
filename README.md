## Resources

### Tutorials

**[StatQuest.](https://statquest.org/video-index/)** A fantastic series of videos having some basic (e.g. probability distributions, t-tests) and some not so basic (e.g. maximum likelihood, PCA) concepts in statistics clearly explained, with a bonus song to start with! Awesome work.

## Notes

* AUC (Area Under the Curve) is the average value of sensitivity for all possible values of specificity.
