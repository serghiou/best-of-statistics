# Best of statistics

A collection of interesting and statistically relevant information and content I find online. 

## Resources

### Tutorials

**[StatQuest.](https://statquest.org/video-index/)** A fantastic series of videos having some basic (e.g. probability distributions, t-tests) and some not so basic (e.g. maximum likelihood, PCA) concepts in statistics clearly explained, with a bonus song to start with! Awesome work.

**[Quantile Regression.](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-quantile-regression-eca5e3e2036a)** A useful introduction to quantile regression using SAS, with a note on relevant packages in other languages. 

**[Evaluation of models based on imbalanced data.](https://machinelearningmastery.com/roc-curves-and-precision-recall-curves-for-classification-in-python/)** This is a quick article suggesting that AUC should only be used for balanced datasets and that models built using imbalanced datasets should be evaluated using precision-recall curves.

## Notes

* AUC (Area Under the Curve) is the average value of sensitivity for all possible values of specificity.
